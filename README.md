## System requirements

ProjectPier requires a *PHP web server* and *MySQL*. The recommended web
server is *Apache*, but IIS 5 and above have been reported to work also.

ProjectPier is **not** PHP4 compatible.

### Recommended configuration:

- PHP 5.2 or greater
- MySQL 4.1 or greater with InnoDB support (see notes below)
- Apache 2.0 or greater

If you do not have these installed on a server or your personal computer,
you can visit the sites below to learn more about how to download and install
them.  They are all licensed under various compatible Open Source licenses.

- PHP    : http://www.php.net/
- MySQL  : http://www.mysql.com/
- Apache : http://www.apache.org/

## Upgrading

If you are upgrading an existing ProjectPier installation,
see **UPGRADE.txt** for an upgrade procedure.

## Installation

See **INSTALL.txt**

### Enabling InnoDB Support

Some installations of MySQL don't support *InnoDB* by default.  The ProjectPier installer
will tell you if your server is not configured to support *InnoDB*. This is easy to fix:

1. Open your MySQL options file, the file name is my.cnf (Linux) - usually at /etc/my.cnf
   or my.ini (Windows) - usually at c:/windows/my.ini.  If you are using the Uniform Server
   on Windows, the file will be named 'my-small' and will need to be edited with a unix
   compatible editor such as SublimeText, Atom, Vim, ...
2. Comment the skip-innodb line by adding # in front of it (like ```#skip-innodb``` ).
3. It would also be good to increase ```max_allowed_packet``` to ensure that
   you'll be able to upload files larger than 1MB. Just add this
   line below #skip-innodb line:

   ```php
   set-variable = max_allowed_packet=64M
   ```

> Alternatively, just install without *InnoDB* support. The installer will allow you.

### Changing the Language

ProjectPier installation screens are in English and English is the default language
for the program. After installation is complete, the language can be changed.

The following base languages are available:
- nl_nl = Dutch
- en_us = English (US)
- de_de = German
- es_es = Spanish
- fr_fr = French

> Other languages packs may be available for download at the site.
